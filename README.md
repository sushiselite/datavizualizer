# datavizualizer
Open source webapp that currently allows users to interactively clean their dataset and generate visuals for their data. (Limited Functionality)

It currently supports very basic functionality and is a work in progress. Feel free to add suggestions through the 'Issues' tab.

It currently is not being hosted anywhere. To run it and test it yourself:

1. Download the latest tag from the 'releases' section.
   
   Alternatively, clone the repository by running:
   
   ```https://github.com/sushiselite/datavizualizer.git```

3. Install necessary dependencies: (in a virtual environment - optional)
   
   ```pip install requirements.txt```

5. Use your terminal to start dev server at localhost:5000 using
   
   ```python app.py```
