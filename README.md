# datavizualizer
Open source webapp that currently allows users to clean interactively their dataset and generate visuals for their data.

It currently supports very basic functionality and is a work in progress. Feel free to add suggestions through the 'Issues' tab.

It currently is not being hosted anywhere. To run it and test it yourself:

1. Clone the repository by running:
   ```https://github.com/sushiselite/datavizualizer.git```

2. Install necessary dependencies: (in a virtual environment - optional)
   ```pip install requirements.txt```

3. Use terminal to start dev server at localhost:5000:
   ```python app.py```

Important things to do:
1. Change file structure
2. Alow users to select columns to generate visuals for
3. Support larger datasets (current support is up to 1000 rows to prevent crashes) âœ…
